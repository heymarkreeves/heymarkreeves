# I’m Mark Reeves.

I build websites & web applications that are stable, secure, and sustainable—not a source of worry. I also consult on web accessibility and infrastructure, and I’m a [Craft CMS Partner](https://craftcms.com/partners/clearbold).

I’ve supported agency partners and clients as [Clearbold](https://clearbold.com) since 2007, managing teams or plugging in as a freelancer as needed. These days I’m typically working in a solo capacity. In 2021 I launched [reeves.studio](https://reeves.studio) to reflect that approach.

- ⌨️ I’m currently working on Craft CMS plugins and client websites built with Craft & Craft Commerce.
- 📚 I’m currently diving deeper on a11y.
