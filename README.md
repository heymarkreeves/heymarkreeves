# I’m Mark Reeves.

I build websites & web applications that are stable, secure, and sustainable—not a source of worry. I also consult on web accessibility and infrastructure, and I’m a [Craft CMS Partner](https://craftcms.com/partners/clearbold).

I’ve supported agency partners and clients as [Clearbold](https://clearbold.com) since 2007, managing teams or plugging in as a freelancer as needed. These days I’m typically working in a solo capacity. In 2021 I launched [reeves.studio](https://reeves.studio) to reflect that approach.

- ⌨️ I’m currently working on Craft CMS plugins and client websites built with Craft & Craft Commerce.
- 📚 I’m currently diving deeper on a11y.
- 👀 I’m on the lookout for API integration projects, including CRM, legacy data, and maps.
- 💬 Ask me about Craft CMS, a11y, prototyping web apps.
- 📧 I prefer to correspond by email, via [reeves.studio](https://reeves.studio).
